FTVisualizer is a tool that visualizes family trees. Since a lot of tools out there 
deal with static visualization of family trees (e.g. graphs), our project will focus 
on building animated visualization based on dates (birthday dates, wedding dates, 
death dates,... etc). This will give a demonstration of how a family grew over a time 
period.

Due to time limitations, we've put the UI which gathers the family data as a second 
priority for now. We will focus our work on the visualization tool and assume that the
family data is stored in a file with a specific format (in the future, the UI should 
create this file through user input and interactions). We are aiming to build this 
tool using OpenGL and C++.
